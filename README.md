# Empty Homes Code

This repository contains the code used for the paper [Empty homes: mapping the extent and value of low-use domestic property in England and Wales](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0216-y), (DOI: doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0216-y) Published by Palgrave Communications.

The data used has been collected using FOI's at local authority level. The FOI data for the code is available in the OSF repository https://osf.io/b3u4d/. The other data sets used by this repository are referenced in the paper. All data used in this paper is publicly available and almost all is under an [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

# Note

Most of the code in this repo has been superceded by the following repositories

- [Inspecting the laundromat](https://github.com/JonnoB/inspecting_the_laundromat)
- [lsoa foi template maker](https://github.com/JonnoB/lsoa_foi_template_maker)

Inspecting the laundromat has updated sampling functions that are much faster. The code is generally easier to read and has less dependencies.
The LSOA FOI template maker, simplifies creating FOI requests for small scale spatial data without breaching the data protection act.
